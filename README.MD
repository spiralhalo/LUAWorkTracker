# Worktime Tracker

Helps you track your work time.

## Use Cases

- Self employed and freelancers who wanted to maximize their work time
- Students trying to commit to a certain study hour per day
- People who wanted to build a good habit in general

## Minimalist Design

This app tracks your work time and that's it. It is meant as a more convenient replacement to pen and paper. It *doesn't* ask for your goals or congratulate you for achieving it, you do that! (with your friends and family!)

## Lightweight

It's made with Love2D, a minimalistic game engine. Why a game engine? Because it provided me with three basic functions: input, graphics, and file i/o. Everything else is coded from scratch, including GUI system. As an added bonus, it's possible to run it on mobile too, as well as other platform that Love2D might support in the future.

# Building the app

See [Love 2D's distribution guide here](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution).

NOTE: To uninstall, remove app data from the user dictionary. For windows, it's located in `%AppData%/<executable_filename>` or `%AppData%/LOVE/<app_folder_name>`.
